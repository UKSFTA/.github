# ⚔️ UKSF Taskforce Alpha | Technical Operations

Welcome to the official technical hub of **UKSF Taskforce Alpha**, a premier Arma 3 tactical realism unit. We maintain a professional-grade development environment where technical excellence meets tactical simulation.

## 🛡️ Platinum DevOps Infrastructure

Our projects are managed by the **UKSFTA Platinum DevOps Suite**, a "Zero Trust" automation toolkit that enforces high standards across our entire ecosystem:

- **🔐 Cryptographic Integrity**: 100% GPG-signed commit history and secure PBO signing.
- **🚀 Continuous Assurance**: Every push undergoes deep semantic analysis (CodeQL), security auditing (Semgrep), and functional validation.
- **📊 Living Documentation**: Automated API tracking and real-time health reporting for unit transparency.
- **🏗️ Standardized VFS**: Unified Virtual File System (`z\uksfta`) to prevent mod conflicts and ensure stability.
